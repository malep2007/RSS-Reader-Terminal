# RSS Reader Terminal
This is a simple RSS Feeder that works in the terminal. It allows a user to enter the link to an RSS feed of their choice and it responds with the details of the stories in that feed. 

It follows a very basic structure from the UML diagram and uses a very simple class to get this done.
